We shall start to add AngularJs to html to power ajax. Spring 4.2 has support for ajax implementation. Spring also provides support for MVC archiecture where it helps to render view as well. We may not require to render dynamic views from server, as angularjs engine will take care of that through SPA design and ajax based dynamic content fetc from backend services over REST API interface.

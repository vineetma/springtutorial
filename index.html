Source code for the project can be accessed at [Github](https://github.com/vineetma/stores).

#Use Case
We have to build a store book keeping mechanism. For this situation, the store is a simple container, which has multiple items. An item is identified by Erp Code, Description, Location. Store also has a location, name.

#Learning
We will slowly build this usecase, using spring framework.

While we build this, we will learn:

+ build using ant (no use of eclipse)
+ do it using eclipse (luna)
+ adding spring libraries
+ injections - constructor, setter
+ aspect oriented programming
